                          SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION


The "Catalogue of Stars within twenty-five parsecs of the Sun" (Woolley, Epps,
Penston and Pocock 1970) was constructed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in
order to enlarge the "Catalogue of Nearby Stars" compiled by Gliese (1957). The
catalogue contains data on stars nearer than 25 pc which are not included in
Gliese's catalogue, plus additional information published since 1957 on stars
in the Gliese compilation.

The machine-readable version of the "Catalogue of Stars within twenty-five
parsecs of the Sun" contains essentially all information given in Table Ia of
the published catalogue, plus positional data and all cross references to
other catalogue numbers given in Table IIa.  Not included from Table Ia are
the flags (asterisks appended to catalogue numbers) indicating notes in the
published catalogue, nor are the notes in machine-readable form.  Omitted from
Table IIa are the finding chart identifiers (Lowell G numbers or notes
reference) and miscellaneous cross identifications to other names and
catalogue identifiers.  Tables Ib and IIb, containing 21 systems originally
included in Gliese's (1957) catalogue, but for which revised parallaxes have
placed them farther than 25 pc, are not included in the machine-readable
version.  A useful extension to the present machine-readable catalogue would
be the addition of the cross identifiers and the creation of a separate file
containing the notes.

This document describes the machine-readable version of the subject catalogue
currently available from the Astronomical Data Center.  Although it should
enable users to read and process the data file without difficulty, and to
interpret the data to some extent, the additional information given in the data
descriptions and the notes in the published catalogue make it advisable to
consult the latter when analyzing and/or intepreting the data in the machine
version.

                          SECTION 2 - FILE CONTENTS


    A byte-to-byte description of the contents of the logical records in the
"Catalogue of Stars within twenty-five parsecs of the Sun" is given in Table 1.
The suggested format specifications are presented in order to clarify the units
and data types, and they can be modified depending upon usage; however, care
must be exercised when using integer and real format specifications in place of
character (A) formats because some data fields contain blanks when data are
absent.  All data is recorded as integers, but real (F) format specifications
are suggested when more appropriate and to show decimal point locations.  Since
data fields are blank for missing data, records should be buffered in or fields
tested in some way to distinguish between blanks and zero.  Alternate
specifications are given in parentheses.  For complete data descriptions, the
user should consult the published catalogue referenced on page 1-1.

                                   numbers starting at 9001 and increasing
                                   with right ascension (1950), but since
                                   numbering of extension, new parallaxes have
                                   removed 9419 and added two new stars:  9849,
                                   9850 (both at R.A. (1950) = 4h 19m),

                                   separately published parallaxes have
                                   generally been assigned separate numbers.

                                   supplement (Jenkins 1952, 1963).  Some
                                   spectroscopic parallaxes are included and
                                   indicated by the probable error code
                                   following.

                                   blank, hence precision can be ascertained
                                   by reading the field in an A format and

                      SECTION 3 - FILE CHARACTERISTICS


The information contained in Table 2 is sufficient to enable a user to read
the machine version of the catalogue.  Information for the entire catalog is
given in the table, but parameters which are easily varied from installation
to installation, such as block size (physical record length), blocking factor
(number of logical records per physical record), total number of blocks, file
density, and coding (EBCDIC, ASCII, BCD) are not included for tape copies. This
information should always be supplied if secondary copies of the machine-
readable catalogue are transmitted to other users or installations.

            SECTION 4 - REMARKS, MODIFICATIONS AND REFERENCES


A magnetic tape version of the "Catalogue of Stars Within twenty-five parsecs
of the Sun" was received from the Centre de Donnees Stellaires, Strasbourg (CDS
catalogue number 5004).  As received the logical record length was 160 bytes
and the file had been recorded in O26 character code.  The file was converted
to O29 code (& converted to + signs, etc.) and reformatted to eliminate all
unnecessary blank characters, thus resulting in the current 135-byte logical
record length.  The remarks coding (bytes 134-135) originally included seven
codes (2-8), as defined in Table 1; however, one star (9785) in the published
catalogue (Table Ia) contains the note "PL NEB", which had not been assigned a
remarks code.  The code 9 has been assigned to the planetary nebula category
and entered into byte 137 of the record for star 9785.
