Abstract:
     The SKY2000 Master Star Catalog is a completely revised and enhanced
     version of the old SKYMAP catalog that has been in use during the last
     2 decades for spacecraft acquisition and tracking applications. The
     previous release of this catalog, still called SKYMAP at the time,
     included new astrometric data and improved and extended
     (near-infrared) photoelectric photometric observations and better data
     for multiple stars. Changes made to produce the current SKY2000
     catalog include reprocessing of the photovisual and photographic
     magnitudes and of the double/multiple-star data, ingestion of star
     identification numbers from the principal astrometric source catalog,
     propagation of positional errors to the standard catalog epoch, and
     addition of several fields for new data. Also, individual errors have
     been detected and corrected. The quality assurance work continues.

INTRODUCTION
   The original SKYMAP Master Star Catalog (Ref 1) was developed to support
   fixed-head star trackers in spacecraft attitude determination software
   developed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
   (NASA's) Goddard Space Flight Center. The original versions were
   designed as a compilation of stellar objects that would be essentially
   complete to a blue or visual magnitude of 9.0. Successive versions of
   the SKYMAP catalog were issued between 1978 and 1993 to correct
   individual errors discovered in each interim, but the basic catalog
   content and format remained the same.

   The development of more accurate star trackers in the late 1980s,
   especially charge-coupled-device-based detector systems, resulted in the
   decision to update the catalog to include magnitude and color data in
   the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum where
   charge-coupled devices have their maximum sensitivity. However, several
   other factors led to the final decision to redesign and build the
   catalog anew. These factors included the availability of vastly superior
   and more abundant primary data, the presence of many "derived" data in
   SKYMAP, inadequate and sometimes erroneous cross identifications, and
   lingering errors for individual stars (especially multiple systems).

   The first edition of the rebuilt catalog was called SKYMAP 4.0 (Ref. 2)
   and its slightly revised successor became SKYMAP 4.0a (Ref 3). Earlier
   versions of the SKYMAP Master Star Catalog were in binary format, but
   the new version was prepared entirely in character-coded (alphanumeric)
   form, which has the advantages of easy access (readability) without
   specialized software and of being able to store data of identifiable and
   variable precision in the same field. Thus, the new catalog stores data
   in an appropriate precision corresponding to their accuracy, and the
   precision can vary within the same data field.

   In addition to the removal of many derived data, wideband photometric
   data in the R (red) and I (infrared) systems were added as new fields.
   However, the major change in Version 4.0 was the replacement of
   astrometric (positions and proper motions) data with more accurate
   values stored at full precision, where appropriate.

   The current version of the SKYMAP Master Star Catalog (4.1), now renamed
   SKY2000 Master Star Catalog, includes additional modifications to
   improve mission support, as well as some reformatted data to comply with
   standard astronomical practice. The primary objectives for SKY2000 are
   to:
      * Improve cross-identification information
      * Generate more realistic positional errors
      * Correct and expand double- and multiple-star data
      * Provide improved reference magnitudes for stars not having
      photoelectrically measured values
      * Port the Master Star Catalog and the associated SKY2000 software
      system from a mainframe to a workstation platform

GENERATION OF NEW SKY2000 MASTER CATALOG
   The following subsections provide additional details on all of the major
   modifications made to Version 4.0a to produce SKY2000. the current
   format specifications for the catalog. summarize the statistics of the
   Master Star Catalog. The final subsection summarizes the work and
   briefly outlines plans for further enhancements.

Incorporation of PPM Numbers into the SKY2000 Master Catalog
   PPM numbers are the primary identifiers for stars in the Catalogue of
   Positions and Proper Motions (PPM) (Ref. 4). The SKYMAP Master Star
   Catalog, Versions 4.0 and 4.0a, contained a data field for the PPM
   numbers, but the data for this field have only recently been
   incorporated into the new SKY2000. The PPM - North, PPM - South, and PPM
   Supplement (Ref. 4) were all used for the PPM number additions and were
   processed individually. To process the PPM catalogs, common identifiers
   between the PPM catalogs and the Master Star Catalog were used: the
   Henry Draper (HD), Durchmusterung (DM), Smithsonian Astrophysical
   Observatory (SAO), and Dritter Katalog der Astronomischen Gesellschaft
   (AGK3) numbers. For each identifier type, software utilities were
   created to find common numbers between the PPM catalogs and the Master
   Star Catalog, and the PPM number for that star was added to SKY2000.
   Each utility executed decreased the number of SKY2000 stars with no PPM
   numbers.

   After all the identifier types were used for PPM number processing, a
   final utility was created and used to search for common positions
   between the PPM catalogs and SKY2000 and to add the PPM number when an
   exact match in position was found. Out of the 299,510 stars in SKY2000,
   approximately 294,000 now contain PPM numbers. Approximately 300 stars
   in SKY2000 can be found in the Bright Star Supplement to the PPM. This
   separate PPM catalog file contains data for bright multiple stars that
   do not have accurate astrometric data measurements in the PPM catalog.
   These stars will need to be processed manually because no common
   identifiers exist between the Supplement and SKY2000. The majority of
   the remaining stars in SKY2000 without PPM numbers are not in the PPM
   catalogs, but a number of problem entries exist--most being for double
   and multiple stars--that remain to be examined.

Photovisual and Photographic Magnitude Reprocessing
   The photovisual (ptv) and photographic (ptg) magnitudes used in SKY2000
   have been obtained directly from the PPM and HD catalogs. The
   reprocessing was accomplished in three separate steps:
   1. Reading the PPM, searching primarily on HD number and secondarily
      on both SAO number and DM identifier. DM identifiers were tested on
      catalog, declination zone, and number in zone. In cases where a star
      does not have an HD number, the SAO and DM entries were considered
      primary identifiers. Where a matching HD number was found and one or
      more of the other identifiers differed, the match was considered
      successful, but a warning message was written to a report file to
      ensure further examination after processing.
   2. Processing a merged catalog, consisting of the HD (Ref. 4) and the
      HD Extension (Ref. 4), to fill gaps, i.e., magnitudes were sought for
      cases in which a ptv or ptg magnitude had not been found in the PPM.
      Again, primary identification was sought by HD number, with only the
      DM identifier being available as a secondary qualification. Entries
      with matching HD numbers and differing DM identifiers were considered
      matches, but a warning message was written to a report file. Only
      values coded as observed were taken.
   3. Reprocessing the HD finding chart (Ref. 4) stars was somewhat
      different. The general approach was that of gap filling, as in step
      two. The primary criterion was again the HD number, but a position
      separation check complemented this test; if it failed, a star would
      be rejected regardless of its HD number. This approach was followed
      after initial examination of the input catalogs revealed several
      stars with matching HD numbers and significantly differing positions.
      A rejection in this case created output to a report file for later
      examination. Of the many types of magnitudes listed in the HD chart
      catalog, only quantities unambiguously identifiable as observed
      magnitudes were taken.

WDS Reprocessing
   The Washington Catalog of Visual Double Stars (WDS) (Ref. 4) was
   reprocessed in a single execution run that consisted of two steps.
      1. All existing multiple-star data in SKY2000 taken from earlier
      versions of the WDS were blanked out.
      2. The WDS was read for each SKY2000 entry and searched for matches
      based on DM number.
   Unfortunately, the WDS does not include alphanumeric catalog prefixes
   (CD, CP, BD, SD). However, it does follow a convention for DM catalogs
   based on declination, but in the overlap zones, identification is not
   certain. Furthermore, the WDS number itself could not be reliably tested
   because these identifiers have changed with various updates of the
   catalog and have not, in all cases, been updated in other catalogs that
   use this identifier. Tests on individual component identifiers are
   necessarily too complex to deal with all cases that may be encountered.
   Designing an algorithm with such flexibility is too time consuming and
   difficult; therefore, the component selection algorithm was limited to
   cases in which several entries in the WDS have the same DM number.
   Within these constraints, matches found in the WDS were placed into the
   output SKY2000 file, overwriting multiple-star information from other
   sources where present. Warning messages were written to a report file in
   cases where input WDS numbers differed for the same DM number or where a
   WDS number did not exist in an input SKY2000 entry matched to a WDS
   entry.

Correction of Individual Errors
   However intelligent the ingestion software may be for catalog work,
   miscellaneous errors inevitably will occur. These errors may result from
   actual errors in the source catalogs or from situations so complex
   (e.g., double and multiple stars) that computer software cannot deal
   with them. A varied assortment of such problems had to be reckoned with
   in the SKY2000 Master Star Catalog, and more will no doubt be
   encountered as the work proceeds. It may be stated with confidence that
   almost all of these problems result from stellar duplicity and
   multiplicity, where component identifiers may be reversed, components
   could not be adequately identified by computer, or multiple systems were
   not treated thoroughly in the source catalogs.

Propagation of Position Uncertainties to the Year 2000
   Position uncertainties in earlier versions of SKYMAP were given at
   epoch. This was also the case for all astrometric catalogs from which
   data were extracted for SKYMAP Version 4.0a, except for the Bright Star
   Catalogue (BSC5) (Ref. 4) and the Bright Star Supplement (BSS) (Ref. 4).
   These two catalogs contained positional data from established
   astrometric source catalogs, but no positional uncertainties. For these,
   the positions were extracted, but average position uncertainties were
   inserted based on the original source catalogs. For example, all stellar
   positions in the BSC5 that originated from Catalogue of Positions and
   Proper Motions (PPM) were given the same average position uncertainty at
   the mean epoch of observation. With the creation of SKY2000, all
   position uncertainties were propagated to epoch 2000.0 using the
   following:

      the uncertainty at 2000.0 = [the uncertainty at the central epoch of
                                  the observations - (t - t(c))**del]**1/2
      where t(c) = the uncertainty of the central epoch of the observations
            del = 2(1-eps)
            eps  = the average uncertainty in proper motion for each source
                   catalog

   Future plans are to replace all average position uncertainties with
   actual values extracted from the source catalogs and propagated to
   2000.0.

SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
   The new SKY2000 Master Star Catalog (SKYMAP Master Catalog, Version 4.1)
   has been prepared to support spacecraft acquisition and tracking
   applications. The major enhancements in SKY2000 include improved cross
   indexing among star designations, propagation of positional error
   estimates to the current catalog epoch (2000.0) to make them more
   realistic, improved ptv and ptg magnitudes throughout the catalog,
   correction of many individual errors present mostly for double and
   multiple stars, and an improved format with more uniform data fields. In
   addition, the entire SKY2000 system has been ported from a mainframe to
   a workstation environment.

      The position uncertainties will be homogenized in a future version of
      SKY2000. The astrometry and photometry will be updated from the
      European Hipparcos space mission data, new ground-based photoelectric
      data will be added, all existing red and infrared data may possibly
      be transformed to the currently used Cousins system, and information
      for double and multiple stars will be improved.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
   The SKY2000 Master Catalog revision was only possible with the help of
   two Computer Sciences Corporation analysts, N. Ottenstein and S.
   Abeyagunawardene, who converted software utilities needed for the
   enhancement effort from the mainframe to the PC and UNIX platforms.
