FLIGHT DYNAMICS' STAR CATALOG DATABASE
SKY2000 MASTER CATALOG / SKYMAP SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES

The SKYMAP Star Catalog System consists of a Master Catalog stellar database 
and a collection of utility software designed to create and maintain the 
database and to generate derivative mission star catalogs (run catalogs). 


THE MASTER CATALOG

The original SKYMAP Master Catalog was generated in the early 1970's. 
Incremental updates and corrections were made over the following years but the
first complete revision of the source data occurred with Version 4.0. This 
revision also served to meet the requirements of the new CCD-based star 
trackers and to produce a unique, consolidated source of astrometric 
information which can be used by the astronomical community. In addition, many
derived quantities were removed and wideband and photometric data in the R 
(red) and I (infrared) systems were added. Additional upgrades and 
improvements were made in Version 4.0a as well. The version following Version 
4.0a is the most recent version and has been named the SKY2000 Master Catalog 
due to the change in format as well as other extensive modifications. This 
version is discussed in detail in the following paragraph. 


The SKY2000 Master Catalog

The new SKY2000 Master Catalog - Version 1 contains 299,485 records with 463 
bytes of data (plus 1 byte control character) per entry and has data based in 
the J2000 coordinate system. This version contains the following upgrades: 

Rehosting of the catalog from a PC-based system to an HP workstation using UNIX 
Modification of the catalog format to conform to well-known source catalogs 
Addition of new star identification information 
Generation of more realistic positional errors 
Correction and expansion of double- and multiple-star data 
Incorporation of improved reference magnitudes for stars not having 
photoelectrically measured values 



A conference paper on the SKY2000 Master Catalog was written that describes 
these upgrades in detail.

There are some deficiencies that exist in the SKY2000 Master Catalog that we 
are aware of. These items will be researched and corrected in future SKY2000 
Master Catalog releases.

The SKYMAP SKY2000 Version 2 Master Catalog 

Version 2 of the SKY2000 Master Catalog was completed in September of 1998 and
represents a substantial improvement over Version 1. A high proportion of the 
astrometric data in Version 2 comes from ESA's Hipparcos mission, by way of 
the Hipparcos Output, Hipparcos Component, and Tycho Catalogues. Astrometric 
data are also present from USNO's ACT Catalog and the European Tycho Reference
Catalogue, both of which refine the proper motions in the original Tycho 
catalog by an order of magnitude. While some objects still retain ACRS and PPM 
data, the proportion is very small and there are no stars left in the catalog 
which do not have astrometric quality positions. A large number of 
photoelectric data on the Johnson system (V, B) has been added from the Tycho 
Catalogue, such that there are now very few stars in SKY2000 that lack 
photoelectric data. More than 4000 stars observed by the Ball CT-601 star 
trackers on the RXTE spacecraft now have observed CCD ST magnitudes in Version
2. IAU designations based on J2000.0 positions have been added to the catalog, 
while all previous identifiers (SKY2000, HD, SAO, DM, HR, WDS, PPM, AG, 
bright- and variable-star designations) have been retained. The IAU-approved 
identifiers allow new objects to be inserted without disrupting the natural 
order of the principal catalog identifier.

catalogs to support attitude determination and analysis for satellites
equipped with star sensors. Star catalogs are a subset of the Master
Catalog and have a standard, eight-word Multi-Modular Spacecraft (MMS)
mission star catalog format.

SOHO Star Catalog

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)

SOHO, one of the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) missions,
is designed to gather information on coronal dynamics, solar flux, and
solar oscillations. SOHO is a joint mission between the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency
(ESA). Data gathered from SOHO will be used with data obtained from other
ISTP missions to understand processes in the Sun-Earth interaction chain.
SOHO was launched from an expendable launch vehicle.

SOHO will be placed into a halo orbit about the sunward libration point
(L1) with a planned mission life of 2 years with enough fuel for a 4-year
extension.

The SOHO spacecraft will maintain a Sun-pointing attitude throughout the
course of the mission using a fine-pointing Sun sensor and will maintain
the roll orientation about the Sun-pointing axis by using a gyro during
maneuvers and a charge-coupled device (CCD) star tracker otherwise. The
star tracker is nominally mounted with its boresight 90 degrees to the
spacecraft X-axis, which is nominally parallel to the Sun-pointing line.
Early in the mission, the X-axis will be aligned with the Sun line. The
SOHO star tracker is produced by Officine Galileo and incorporates a
band-pass filter to provide tracker spectral response characteristics
similar to the visual spectrum.

SOHO SKYMAP Mission Run Catalog

   * The Run Catalog generated has stars as faint as +8.0 instrumental
     magnitudes.
   * The star tracker's instrument magnitude is normalized to the visual
     magnitude of spectral class A0V stars.
   * The quality of a potential guide star in the SOHO Run Catalog is
     gauged by the magnitude of the various quality flags within the limits
     given below:
        o Variability: largest known variability in amplitude flagged is 10
          magnitudes;
        o Color: the largest difference between the V magnitude and the
          Instrumental magnitude flagged is 2 magnitudes;
        o Multiplicity: This flag maps a multiple star related to this star
          in the range of 0.5 and 6 magnitudes difference.
        o Net position error of primary stars as a result of near neighbor
          interference between -1 and 1000 arcseconds;
        o Position measurement errors contained in the SKYMAP Master
          Catalog between 0 and 150 (arcseconds);
        o Instrumental magnitude errors written to the SWAS Run Catalog
          between 0 and 3.25;
        o Near-neighbor trackability flag was not turned on;
        o Near-neighbor identifiability flag was not turned on.
   * The SKYMAP Version 4.0 Master Catalog was used to generate the SOHO
     Run Catalog.

XTE Star Catalog

The X-ray Timing Explorer (XTE)

The X-ray Timing Explorer (XTE) is designed to gather data about
X-ray-emitting objects within the Milky Way and beyond. XTE performs timing
studies of X-ray sources, which vary in the intensity of their emissions,
and spectral studies, which will reveal emission processes and locations of
regions emitting X-rays. The spacecraft was launched on a Delta II rocket
on December 30, 1995 from Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida.

The XTE mission baseline requires a 580 km low earth orbit with a 23 degree
inclination. XTE is a three-axis stabilized inertial pointing spacecraft.
The attitude determination and control hardware of the spacecraft consists
of one onboard computer (OBC), two three-axis magnetometers (TAM), eight
coarse Sun sensors (CSSs), two digital Sun sensor (DSS), three two-axis
inertial reference units (IRUs), two charged-couple device (CCD) star
trackers, two three-axis magnetic torquer assemblies (MTA), one four-wheel
reaction wheel assembly (RWA) and one experimental inertial fiber-optic
gyro (IFOG).

XTE SKYMAP Mission Run Catalog

  1. The Run Catalog generated has stars as faint as +7.0 instrumental
     magnitudes.
  2. The star tracker instrumental magnitude is normalized to the visual
     magnitude of spectral class A0V stars.
  3. To prevent anomalous star intensity and position due to the images of
     near neighbors, during the Run Catalog generation, the near neighbors
     of each star catalog star are considered.
  4. The quality of a potential guide star in the XTE Run Catalog is gauged
     by the magnitude of the various quality flags within the limits given
     below:

     (a) variability: the largest variability mapped in amplitude is 10
     magnitudes;

     (b) color: the value of the largest mapped difference between the V
     magnitude and the I magnitude is 3 magnitudes;

     (c) multiplicity: a star is considered to be a multiple star if the
     magnitude difference between the star and its nearest star is between
     0.5 and 6 magnitudes; if the nearest star is either greater than or
     equal to 6 magnitudes fainter or the nearest star is less than 2.0
     arcseconds away (which is the sensor resolution ), it is not likely
     that it is a multiple star; if the above conditions are not present
     the star is not a multiple star or multiple star is treated as a near
     neighbor;

     (d) Net position error of primary stars as a result of near neighbor
     interference between 10 and 1000 arcseconds is mapped;

     (e) All position measurement errors contained in the XTE Run Catalog
     are mapped;

     (f) Instrumental magnitude uncertainties written to the XTE Run
     Catalog between 0 and 2.5 are mapped;

     (g) Near-neighbor trackability maps the nearest star either brighter
     than or up to 4 magnitudes fainter for angles to the star between 0
     and 1.0 degrees;

     (h) Near-neighbor identifiability maps the nearest star within 1
     magnitude for angles to the star between 0 and 5.0 degrees.

  5. The SKYMAP Version 4.0a Master Catalog is used to generate the XTE Run
     Catalog. Observed instrumental magnitudes from XTE tracked stars were
     analyzed and compared to the SKYMAP magnitude predictions, and based
     on this analysis, a correlation was found between the size of the
     difference in the magnitudes and the star's spectral class. All the
     instrumental magnitudes in the XTE Run Catalog were then tweaked based
     on the correlation found.

The XTE mission star catalog has eight columns with the following
characteristics:

  1. SKYMAP Number
  2. G.C.I. unit vector (x) mean J2000
  3. G.C.I. unit vector (y) mean J2000
  4. G.C.I. unit vector (z) mean J2000
  5. Instrumental magnitude for CCD
  6. Proper Motion
  7. Quality Flags (4 bit flags)
  8. Color Word

SWAS Star Catalog

Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS)

The Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) is designed to
investigate molecular clouds in the galactic plane and to study
extragalactic sources of radiation in the submillimeter range. The main
science instrument on the spacecraft consists of an off-axis Cassegrain
telescope, a two-channel receiver, an acoustic optical spectrometer,
instrument control electronics and a thermal control system. The mission
has a planned lifetime of 36 months.

The SWAS mission baseline requires a 600 km circular orbit with a 65 degree
inclination. SWAS is a three-axis stabilized inertial pointing spacecraft.
The attitude determination and control hardware of the spacecraft consists
of one onboard computer (OBC), one three-axis magnetometer (TAM), six
coarse Sun sensors (CSSs), one digital Sun sensor (DSS), three two-axis
inertial reference units (IRUs), one charged-couple device (CCD) star
tracker, one three-axis magnetic torquer assembly (MTA) and one four-wheel
reaction wheel assembly (RWA). Science data will be collected when the
spacecraft is pointing at specific source and off-source targets as
specified from the ground. Three different scenarios for science data
collection are planned. In one scenario the spacecraft will remain at one
attitude for an extended period of time. In a second scenario, the
spacecraft will nod between on-source and off-source targets every minute,
for up to 20 minutes at a time. In the third scenario, the spacecraft will
map a region of the galactic plane by pointing at a series of preset
gridpoints 2 arcminutes apart. Science data will be collected during these
three scenarios.

LANDSAT-7 SKYMAP Mission Run Catalog

Landsat-7 Satellite

Landsat-7 is designed to provide remote sensing of the Earth and return
data that can either be processed into images or used in digital form for
scientific, military and commercial applications. Its multispectral imaging
payload consists of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), which is kept
continuously pointing towards the Earth during each orbit by the attitude
control subsystem (ACS) employed by the satellite. It will provide data
continuity with the Landsat-4 and -5 payloads, as well as add a
panchromatic band and an enhanced resolution of the long wavelength
infrared band.

The major sensors and actuators on Landsat-7 that provide control of its
orbit and attitude consist of 1 inertial measurement unit (IMU), 1
celestial sensor assembly (CSA), 1 Earth sensor assembly (ESA), 2
three-axis magnetometers (TAMs), 1 coarse Sun sensor (CSS) which includes 2
array-mounted and 1 body-mounted CSS units, 4 reaction wheel assemblies
(RWAs), 2 magnetic torquer rods (MTRs), hydrazine jets (orbit adjust and
momentum management), 1 rotatable solar array (SA), 3 gimbaled X-band
antennas (GXAs) and 2 S-band Omni antennas.

Landsat-7 spacecraft will be launched on a Delta II Expendable Launch
Vehicle (ELV) from the west coast of the United States in May 1998. It will
be injected into a Sun-synchronous near-polar orbit (98.2 degree
inclination) at a nominal altitude of 705 kilometers with a descending node
mean local time (MLT) of 10:00 A.M. Its life time is expected to be 5
years.

For Landsat-7, both a Run Catalog and a Supplemental Catalog were
generated. The Run Catalog provides data based on mission-specific
requirements. For example, the Run Catalog contains instrumental magnitudes
that are calculated using the Landsat-7 sensor sensitivity curve with the
observed visual or red magnitudes of the star. The Supplemental Catalog is
generated after the Run Catalog and contains the same set of stars that are
in the Run Catalog. However, this catalog provides additional generic star
information that is not contained in the Run Catalog, and that the mission
needs for analysis purposes. The formats for these catalogs are described
below.

                    Landsat-7 SKYMAP Mission Run Catalog

  1. The Run Catalog generated has stars as faint as +4.75 instrumental
     magnitudes.

  2. The star tracker instrumental magnitude is normalized to the visual
     magnitude of spectral class A0V stars.

  3. To prevent anomalous star intensity and position due to the images of
     near neighbors, during the Run Catalog generation, the near neighbors
     of each star catalog star are considered.

  4. The quality of a potential guide star in the Landsat-7 Run Catalog is
     gauged by the magnitude of the various quality flags within the limits
     given below:

     (a) variability: the largest variability amplitude bin flag is set to
     10 magnitudes;

     (b) color: the value of the largest bin giving the difference between
     the V magnitude and the I magnitude is 3 magnitudes;

     (c) multiplicity: This flag is set so that the star is flagged as a
     multiple star if the magnitude difference between the star and its
     nearest star is between 0.5 and 6 magnitudes; if the nearest star is
     either greater than or equal to 6 magnitudes fainter or the nearest
     star is less than 4.2 arcseconds away (which is the sensor resolution
     ) it is not likely that it is a multiple star; if the above conditions
     are not present the star is not a multiple star or multiple star is
     treated as a near neighbor;

     (d) Net position error of primary stars as a result of near neighbor
     interference between -1 and 1000 arcseconds is mapped;

     (e) Position measurement errors contained in the Landsat-7 Run Catalog
     are flagged for errors with values between 0 and 150 (arcseconds);

     (f) Instrumental magnitude uncertainties written to the Landsat-7 Run
     Catalog between 0 and 2.5;

     (g) Near-neighbor trackability maps the nearest star either brighter
     than or up to 4 magnitudes fainter for angles to the star between 0
     and 1.0 degrees;

     (h) Near-neighbor identifiability maps the nearest star within 1
     magnitude for angles to the star between 0 and 5.0 degrees.

  5. The SKYMAP Version 4.0a Master Catalog is used to generate the
     Landsat-7 Run Catalog.

                       Landsat-7 Supplemental Catalog

A description of the Landsat-7 Supplemental Catalog format is given below:

EOS AM-1 Star Catalog

Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE) is the NASA contribution to the USGCRP
(United States Global Change Research Program) and the Earth Observing
System (EOS) is the centerpiece of that effort. EOS is a fifteen-year
program consisting of a series of Earth remote sensing spacecraft to study
the atmosphere, oceans, cyrosphere, biosphere and solid Earth. Key issues
to be explored and understood are the interrelationships between these
components of the Earth system and the flow of energy, water and chemicals
among them. Each series will have several spacecraft, thereby enabling
continuous observations over the program's lifetime. When fully implemented
the EOS constellation will have as many as five spacecraft (one from each
series) in orbit simultaneously and conducting routine operations.

The first series of spacecraft to launch is the AM series ( AM refers to
the morning equatorial crossing of 10:30 GMT required to accommodate
cloud-cover constraints), with the first launch designated as EOS-AM1. The
EOS AM-1 spacecraft will be launched by an Atlas II AS expendable launch
vehicle from the Western Test Range (WTR) at Vandenberg Air Force Base
(VAFB) into a frozen, Sun-synchronous orbit inclined at 98.2 degrees. The
mean altitude will be 705 km over the Equator, with a descending node mean
local time (MLT) of 10:30 AM (+/- 15 minutes). Currently, launch is
scheduled for June 1998, with a required 5-year lifetime. EOS AM-1 will fly
in a constellation with Landsat-7.

The spacecraft will carry instruments capable of producing high-resolution
images of land, water, and clouds from the visible through infrared
spectrum. The EOS AM spacecraft will provide detailed measurements of
clouds, aerosols and the Earth's radiative energy balance, together with
measurements of the land surface and its interaction with the atmosphere
through exchanges of energy, carbon and water. These interactive processes
present scientific questions of the highest priority to understanding
global climate change. The instruments will provide a 5-year data set on
the atmospheric radiative balance and the physical and radiative properties
of clouds (ASTER, CERES, MISR, MODIS); high resolution observations of
land, ocean, ice surface and cloud processes (ASTER, MISR, MODIS); vertical
profiles of important greenhouse gases (MOPITT, MODIS); vegetation
structure and dynamics (MISR, MODIS, ASTER); and volcanology (ASTER, MISR,
MODIS). Specific information on the EOS AM1 science instrument complement
may be obtained from:

http://newsroom.gsfc.nasa.gov/fos/eos-am1/eos-am1.html and from
http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/

EOS AM-1 is a 3-axis stabilized, Earth-pointing spacecraft. The Attitude
Determination and Control System (ADACS) consists of an Onboard Computer
(OBC) and the following sensors and actuators:

   * Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA) (2)
   * Three-Axis Magnetometer (TAM) (2)
   * Coarse Sun Sensor (CSS) (2)
   * Digital Fine Sun Sensor (DSS) (1)
   * CCD Solid State Star Tracker (SSST) (2)
   * Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) (2 units of 3-axis gyros)
   * Magnetic Torquer Assembly (MTA) (1 unit of 3-axes)
   * Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) (1 unit, 4 wheels)
   * Attitude Control Thrusters (6 Primary, 6 Redundant)

EOS AM1 Mission Star Catalog

A star catalog was produced using SKYMAP Version 4.0a to support the EOS
AM1 onboard and ground based attitude control/determination systems. The
Multimission Modular Spacecraft run catalog format is used as shown below:

  1. The Run Catalog generated has stars as faint as +5.7 instrumental
     magnitudes.
  2. The star tracker instrumental magnitude is normalized to the visual
     magnitude of spectral class G2V stars.
  3. To prevent anomalous star intensity and position due to the images of
     near neighbors, during the Run Catalog generation, the near neighbors
     of each star catalog star are considered.
  4. The quality of a potential guide star in the XTE Run Catalog is gauged
     by the magnitude of the various quality flags within the limits given
     below:

     (a) variability: the largest variability mapped in amplitude is 10
     magnitudes;

     (b) color: the range of differences between the V magnitude and the I
     magnitude is -10 to + 3 magnitudes;

     (c) multiplicity: a star is considered to be a multiple star if the
     magnitude difference between the star and its nearest star is between
     0.25 and 5 magnitudes; if the nearest star is either greater than or
     equal to 5 magnitudes fainter or the nearest star is less than 5.0
     arcseconds away (which is the sensor resolution ), it is not likely
     that it is a multiple star; if the above conditions are not present
     the star is not a multiple star or multiple star is treated as a near
     neighbor;

     (d) Net position error of primary stars as a result of near neighbor
     interference between 0 and 1000 arcseconds is mapped;

     (e) All position measurement errors contained in the EOS AM1 Run
     Catalog are mapped;

     (f) Instrumental magnitude uncertainties written to the EOS AM1 Run
     Catalog between 0 and 2.5 are mapped with those between 2.5 and 999.0
     contained in a single bin;

     (g) Near-neighbor trackability maps the nearest star either brighter
     than or up to 5 magnitudes fainter for angles to the star between 0
     and 1.0 degrees;

     (h) Near-neighbor identifiability maps the nearest star within 0.75
     magnitude for angles to the star between between 0 and 5.0 degrees.

  5. The SKYMAP Version 4.0a Master Catalog is used to generate the EOS AM1
     Run Catalog.

The EOS AM1 mission star catalog has eight columns with the following
characteristics:

  1. SKYMAP Number
  2. G.C.I. unit vector (x) mean J2000
  3. G.C.I. unit vector (y) mean J2000
  4. G.C.I. unit vector (z) mean J2000
  5. Instrumental magnitude for CCD
  6. Proper Motion
  7. Quality Flags (4 bit flags)
  8. Color Word

Significant post processing was done on the Run Catalog by FDD and
McDonnel-Douglas personnel to reduce the catalog to ~700 of the best guide
stars with equal distribution. The final report by P. Kudva (in Microsoft
Word format) is available here.

Star Trackers

The "first generation" star trackers, e.g., the NASA-Standard Fixed-Head
Star Tracker (FHST) using analog photomultiplier technology, were designed
to provide peak sensor response near the visual portion of the stellar
spectrum. Therefore, measured "visual" stellar magnitudes (Mv), the most
commonly measured stellar spectral band, were sufficient to predict
instrumental magnitudes for the FHST's. However, with the advent of
charge-coupled device (CCD)-based star sensors, which characteristically
have peak sensitivities biased toward the "red/infrared" portion of the
stellar spectra, additional spectral data were necessary to accurately
predict instrumental magnitudes.
