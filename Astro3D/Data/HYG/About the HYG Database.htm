<H2 align=center>The HYG Database v1.1</H2>
<P><EM>Update (12 Feb. 2004):</EM> Several variants are now available with 
different magnitude cutoffs. See below for more information.</P>
<P>The HYG database (v1.1) is a compilation of interesting (to me, anyway) 
stellar data from a variety of catalogs. It is useful for background information 
on all sorts of data: star names, positions, brightnesses, distances, and 
spectrum information.</P>
<H3>Downloads</H3>
<P>Choose the version of the database that best serves your needs:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/data/hyg.csv.zip">HYG to 
  7.5:</A> Database containing all stars brighter than magnitude +7.5, or closer 
  than 50 parsecs. This is the same as the "Version 1.0" database that has been 
  on this site before. (31858 stars) 
  <LI><A href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/data/hyg80.csv.gz">HYG to 
  8.0:</A> Database containing all stars brighter than magnitude +8.0, or closer 
  than 50 parsecs. (46786 stars) 
  <LI><A href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/data/hyg85.csv.gz">HYG to 
  8.5:</A> Database containing all stars brighter than magnitude +8.5, or closer 
  than 50 parsecs. (66392 stars) 
  <LI><A href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/data/hygfull.csv.gz">Full 
  database:</A> Database containing all stars brighter than magnitude +9.0, or

<H3>About the HYG Database</H3>
<P>The database is a subset of the data in three major catalogs: the Hipparcos 
Catalog,the Yale Bright Star Catalog (5th Edition), and the Gliese Catalog of 
Nearby Stars (3rd Edition). Each of these catalogs contains information useful 
to amateur astronomers:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The Hipparcos catalog is the largest collection of high-accuracy stellar 
  positional data, particularly parallaxes, which makes it useful as a starting 
  point for stellar distance data. 
  <LI>The Yale Bright Star Catalog contains basic data on essentially all 
  naked-eye stars, including much information (such as the traditional Bayer 
  Greek letters and Flamsteed numbers) missing from many other catalogs 
  <LI>The Gliese catalog is the most comprehensive catalog of nearby stars 
  (those within 75 light years of the Sun). It contains many fainter stars not 
  found in Hipparcos. </LI></UL>
<P>The name of the database comes from the three catalogs comprising its data: 
<EM>H</EM>ipparcos, <EM>Y</EM>ale, and <EM>G</EM>liese.</P>
<P>All told, this database contains ALL stars that are either brighter than a 
cetain magnitude cutoff (magnitude +7.5 to +9.0) or within 50 parsecs (about 160 
light years) from the Sun.</P>
<P>The database is a comma separated values (CSV) file that can be imported into 
most database and spreadsheet programs. On this web site it is stored as a Zip 
file or a GZ file, which most popular unzippers can open.</P>
<P>Be aware that many spreadsheet programs (Excel, for example) have a cutoff of 
64K (65,536) lines of input from a CSV or similar file. If you plan to use a 
spreadsheet program to play with the data, you may have an easier time with the 
two smaller databases (7.5 and 8.0 magnitude cutoffs).</P>
<H3>Fields in the Database</H3>
<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>StarID:</STRONG> The database primary key from a larger "master 
  database" of stars. 
  <LI><STRONG>HD:</STRONG> The star's ID in the Henry Draper catalog, if known. 
  <LI><STRONG>HR:</STRONG> The star's ID in the Harvard Revised catalog, which 
  is the same as its number in the Yale Bright Star Catalog. 
  <LI><STRONG>Gliese:</STRONG> The star's ID in the third edition of the Gliese 
  Catalog of Nearby Stars. 
  <LI><STRONG>BayerFlamsteed:</STRONG> The Bayer / Flamsteed designation, from 
  the Fifth Edition of the Yale Bright Star Catalog. This is a combination of 
  the two designations. The Flamsteed number, if present, is given first; then a 
  three-letter abbreviation for the Bayer Greek letter; the Bayer superscript 
  number, if present; and finally, the three-letter constellation abbreviation. 
  Thus Alpha Andromedae has the field value "21Alp And", and Kappa<SUP>1</SUP> 
  Sculptoris (no Flamsteed number) has "Kap1Scl". 
  <LI><STRONG>RA, Dec:</STRONG> The star's right ascension and declination, for 
  epoch 2000.0. Stars present only in the Gliese Catalog, which uses 1950.0 
  coordinates, have had these coordinates precessed to 2000. 
  <LI><STRONG>ProperName:</STRONG> A common name for the star, such as 
  "Barnard's Star" or "Sirius". I have taken these names primarily from the 
  Hipparcos project's web site, which lists representative names for the 150 
  brightest stars and many of the 150 closest stars. I have added a few names to 
  this list. Most of the additions are designations from catalogs mostly now 
  forgotten (e.g., Lalande, Groombridge, and Gould ["G."]) except for certain 
  nearby stars which are still best known by these designations. 
  <LI><STRONG>Distance:</STRONG> The star's distance in parsecs, the most common 
  unit in astrometry. To convert parsecs to light years, multiply by 3.262. A 
  value of 10000000 indicates missing or dubious (e.g., negative) parallax data 
  in Hipparcos. 
  <LI><STRONG>Mag:</STRONG> The star's apparent visual magnitude. 
  <LI><STRONG>AbsMag:</STRONG> The star's absolute visual magnitude (its 
  apparent magnitude from a distance of 10 parsecs). 
  <LI><STRONG>Spectrum:</STRONG> The star's spectral type, if known. 
  <LI><STRONG>ColorIndex:</STRONG> The star's color index (blue magnitude - 
  visual magnitude), where known. </LI></OL>
<H3>Techie Database Details</H3>
<H4>Database Construction</H4>
<P>I came up with this database while creating the <A 
href="http://www.astronexus.com/general/3duniv/index.html" target=_parent>3D 
Universe</A> web site. I needed a reference that would let me search for groups 
of stars by magnitude or distance, while giving me more information than was 
contained in any one catalog.</P>
<P>I started with the Hipparcos data. The Hipparcos data set represents by far 
the most comprehensive collection of stellar distance and brightness data in 
existence, except for very low-luminosity stars. Essentially all naked-eye stars 
(in fact, most stars down to about apparent magnitude +9) are represented in the 
Hipparcos catalog.</P>
<P>The Hipparcos catalog contains over 100,000 stars and to help keep things 
more manageable, I first prepared a subset, both of the stars and of the fields 
in the data set, of around 75,000 of the brightest stars in the catalog.</P>
<P>I next consulted the Gliese catalog to fill in gaps in the Hipparcos catalog, 
and to add various Gliese data to the catalog. In particular, the Gliese catalog 
ID is a common reference for nearby stars, and the Gliese catalog contains 
radial velocity data, which Hipparcos lacks. Additionally, though Hipparcos 
distances are generally superior to Gliese data, the Hipparcos catalog missed 
many nearby stars that were below its magnitude cutoff.</P>
<P>To cross-reference stars, I used the Henry Draper catalog number, whenever 
present, to add Gliese data to the Hipparcos catalog. Many of the faintest stars 
lacked this catalog number, so I compared the positions and brightnesses of 
Gliese stars to those in Hipparcos, and if they matched to within a certain 
tolerance, I assigned the appropriate Gliese data to the Hipparcos star. Stars 
that failed both references were then added to the end of the Hipparcos 
list.</P>
<P>I also converted Hipparcos apparent magnitudes to Gliese values for all 
components of known multiple stars in the latter catalog. Again, the Hipparcos 
magnitude measurements are often superior, but the Hipparcos catalog treats 
multiple stars inconsistently. In particular, it breaks some out as separate 
stars (e.g., Alpha Centauri) but merges others (such as Capella, 70 Ophiuchi, 
and many others). By contrast the Gliese catalog breaks all known multiple 
stars, excluding those too close to be separated optically, into their 
components, and gives each one a magnitude.</P>
<P>I then calculated absolute magnitudes for all stars, added those to the 
database, and added about 250 proper names. Then, again using Henry Draper as a 
cross reference, I added data from the Yale Bright Star Catalog: HR numbers, 
radial velocities (if not already added from Gliese), and the Bayer and 
Flamsteed designations.</P>
<P>These steps resulted in the full database. To make the various subsets, I 
took the resulting database (now containing about 80000 stars and over 25 fields 
in each data record) and extracted subsetw of the data.</P>
<H4>Database Quality Issues</H4>
<P>With over 80,000 stars to worry about, I generally couldn't go in and edit 
suspect records by hand. Consequently, there are some issues that serious users 
may want to be aware of:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The spectral types, in general, come from the Hipparcos catalog. A few 
  stars -- those found <EM>only</EM> in Gliese, have a spectral type from that 
  catalog. The spectral types from Hipparcos have not been closely vetted and I 
  have already found some probable errors. For example, the spectral type of 36 
  Ophiuchi B (a double star that was merged in Hipparcos) is given as K2 III 
  (giant), when its luminosity clearly indicates K2 V (main sequence). Also, the 
  star HIP 84720 (Gliese 666 A) is listed as M0 V, whereas its luminosity and 
  color index are more consistent with a late G-type star (about G8 V). M0 V 
  appears to be the spectral type of Gliese 666 B, a companion to this star. Use 
  the spectral types with caution. 
  <LI>There may be errors in the Henry Draper numbers in one or more catalogs, 
  leading to false cross-references. 
  <LI>There may be errors in the matching of Gliese stars to Hipparcos stars by 
  position and magnitude. In general, this is likely to be an issue only for 
  multiple stars with highly uncertain magnitudes in both catalogs, as the 
  position constraints were fairly severe (stars had to have positions matching 
  to +/- 0.15 degrees, less than the radius of the full Moon). I have not seen 
  any apparent errors on scanning the database thus far, but this is one area 
  that could be a problem. </LI></UL>
<P>In short, though I have done what I can, I can't warrant the database to be 
error-proof. If you need to launch probes to all the stars in the database, you 
might want to give it a more thorough going-over before doing so :-)</P>
<H4>More techie stuff</H4>
<P>I have created a short Perl script that will read the database as is (no need 
to import it into another program), run a SQL query on it, and then save the 
query results to an HTML page for viewing. It uses Microsoft's Open Database 
Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and so, right now, only works on Windows platforms 
(95/98/NT). The script is very much beta; it also requires the Perl executable, 
a basic knowledge of SQL, and enough general geekiness to edit a Perl script 
without killing it. I will E-mail it to anyone who is interested, and will post 
a copy of it here if interest is high enough.</P>
<P>If none of that makes any sense, just pop the CSV file into your favorite 
database or spreadsheet program, and ignore the previous paragraph.</P>
<H4>Other Issues</H4>
<P>The data in this database are subject to change. I may add or delete stuff as 
I feel like. If there are any really large changes, I will post copies to this 
site.</P>
